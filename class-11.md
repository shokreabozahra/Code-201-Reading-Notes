# Chapter 16: “Images”
## Controlling size of images in CSS
### You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box. Specifying image sizes helps pages to load more smoothly because the HTML and CSS code will often load before the images, and telling the browser how much space to leave for an image allows it to render the rest of the page without waiting for the image to download.
## Aligning images Using Css
### There are two ways that this is commonly achieved:
1. The float property is added to the class that was created to represent the size of the image.

2. New classes are created with names such as align-left or align-right to align the images to the left or right of the page. These class names are used in addition to classes that indicate the size of the image.

## shorthand background
### The background property acts like a shorthand for all of the other background properties you have just seen, and also the background-color property. The properties must be specified in the following order, but you can miss any value if you do not want to specify it.
1. background-color
2. background-image
3. background-repeat
4. background-attachment
5. background-position

>Background images can appear just once or be
repeated across the background of the box.

>You can create image rollover effects by moving the
background position of an image.

>To reduce the number of images your browser has to
load, you can create image sprites.
