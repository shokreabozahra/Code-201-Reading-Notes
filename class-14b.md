# What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team
### The company’s top executives long believed that building the best teams meant combining the best people. They embraced other bits of conventional wisdom as well, like ‘‘It’s better to put introverts together,’’ said Abeer Dubey, a manager in Google’s People Analytics division, or ‘‘Teams are more effective when everyone is friends away from work.’’ But, Dubey went on, ‘‘it turned out no one had really studied which of those were true.’’

### In a time of global commerce, teamwork is more important than ever before. In the last two decades, teamwork in businesses has increased by 50% or more, and interpersonal communication accounts for 75% of an employee’s day. Businesses can’t afford to underestimate the power of strong teams.

### Google’s “Project Artistotle” investigates why some teams work better than others. Its analysis shows that the combination of individuals making up the group is unimportant. Instead, a team’s “group norms” – its “traditions, behavioral standards.

> In 2012, the company embarked on an initiative — code-named Project Aristotle — to study hundreds of Google’s teams and figure out why some stumbled while others soared.
