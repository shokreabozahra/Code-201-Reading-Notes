# Lists:
## HTML lists allow web developers to group a set of related items in lists.
# HTML lists types:
 <h2> Unordered HTML List <h2>

### An unordered list starts with the ul tag Each list item starts with the li tag.The list items will be marked with bullets (small black circles) by default.

<h2>Ordered HTML List<h2>

### An ordered list starts with the ol tag. Each list item starts with the li tag. The list items will be marked with numbers by default.

<h2>HTML Definition Lists<h2>

### A definition list is a list of terms, with a definition of each term.The dl tag defines the definition list, the dt tag defines the term (name), and the dd tag definition each term.
## Nested Lists: 
### You can put a second list inside an li element to create a sublist or nested list.

# Boxes:
## Box Dimensions
### The CSS box-sizing property allows us to include the padding and border in an element's total width and height.

## CSS Box Model
### All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.

### The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.

- Content: The content of the box, where text and images appear
- Padding: Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
- Border : A border that goes around the padding and content
- Margin : Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent
#### The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements. 

## CSS Padding
### The CSS padding properties are used to generate space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders.
### CSS has properties for specifying the padding for each side of an element:

- padding-top
- padding-right
- padding-bottom
- padding-left

## CSS Border Properties
### The CSS border properties allow you to specify the style, width, and color of an element's border.
## CSS Border Style
- dotted: Defines a dotted border
- dashed: Defines a dashed border
- solid :Defines a solid border
- double: Defines a double border
- groove: Defines a 3D grooved border. The effect depends on the border-color value
- ridge :Defines a 3D ridged border. The effect depends on the border-color value
- inset :Defines a 3D inset border. The effect depends on the border-color value
- outset: Defines a 3D outset border. The effect depends on the border-color value
- none : Defines no border
- hidden : Defines a hidden border

## CSS Margins
### The CSS margin properties are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.

### You can specify values for each side of a box using:
- margin-top
- margin-right
- margin-bottom
- margin-left

## display property
### The display property specifies the display behavior (the type of rendering box) of an element.

 
 - inline      : 	Displays an element as an inline element (like span). Any height and width properties will have no  effect	
 - block	   :     Displays an element as a block element (like p). It starts on a new line, and takes up the whole width
 - inline-block :  Displays an element as an inline-level block container. The element itself is formatted as an inline - element, but you can apply height and width values
 - none : The element is completely removed

## IF ... ELSE  VS.  SWITCH

 > If ..else : There is no need to provide an el se
option. (You can just use an if
statement.)
• With a series of if statements, they are
all checked even if a match has been found
(so it performs more slowly than switch).


> Switch : You have a default option that is run if
none of the cases match.
• If a match is found, that code is run; then
the break statement stops the rest of
the switch statement running (providing
better performance than multiple i f
statements). 

## Loop counters
### In computer programming a loop counter is the variable that controls the iterations of a loop.

>Data types can be coerced from one type to another.

>All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.

>There are three types of loop: for, while, and
do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
