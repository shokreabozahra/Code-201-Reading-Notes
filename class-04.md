# Links

### The most important attribute of the (a) element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination. The link text is the part that will be visible to the reader. Clicking on the link text, will send the reader to the specified URL address.
- Use the (a) element to define a link
- Use the href attribute to define the link address
- Use the target attribute to define where to open the linked document
- Use the (img) element (inside a) to use an image as a link
- Use the mailto: scheme inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program


## links will appear as follows in all browsers:

- An unvisited link is underlined and blue
- A visited link is underlined and purple
- An active link is underlined and red

## Relative Link:
### A relative link is any link that shows the current URL's relation to the linked page's URL. Instead of having the whole reference URL in the h-ref tag, relative links only show the relative link paths, as their name suggests. It's the difference between a link that has the website's full address, and a link that only includes a file's specific location.

## Relative Link Type
- Same Folder     
- Grandchild Folder
- Child Folder    
- Parent Folder
- GrandParent Folder

## Link to an Email Address
### Use mailto: inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program (to let them send a new email)

> If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is
best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.

> You can use the id attribute to target elements within
a page that can be linked to.

# Layout
## Key Concepts in Positioning Elements:
## Building Blocks
### CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block or an inline box. Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text. You can control how much space each box takes up by setting the width of the boxes (and sometimes the height, too). To separate boxes, you can use borders, margins, padding, and background colors.

## Controlling the Position of Elements:
<h2>1. Normal flow<h2>
 
### In normal flow, each block-level element sits on top of the next one. Since this is the default way in which browsers treat HTML elements, you do not need a CSS property to indicate that elements should appear in normal flow, but the syntax would be: position: static.

<h2>2.Relative Positioning<h2>

### Relative positioning moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow.

<h2>3.Absolute positioning<h2>

### When the position property is given a value of absolute, the box is taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the position of other elements on the page.

# Functions, Methods and Objects

## Functions
### Functions are like recipes. They can execute a set of instructions on data or variables and return the result. The beauty of functions is that they are recyclable. That is, the function can be used repeatedly without having to write the same code again.

## Methods
### A method, like a function, is a set of instructions that perform a task. The difference is that a method is associated with an object, while a function is not.

## Object 
- Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.

- Object properties can be both primitive values, other objects, and functions.

- An object method is an object property containing a function definition.

## VARIABLE SCOPE 
<h2>1.Local JavaScript Variables<h2>

- Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function.

- Local variables have Function scope: They can only be accessed from within the function.

<h2>2.Global JavaScript Variables <h2>

- A variable declared outside a function, becomes GLOBAL.

- A global variable has global scope: All scripts and functions on a web page can access it.
