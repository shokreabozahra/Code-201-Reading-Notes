# Structure
## Basic structure of an HTML document
 ## An HTML document has two* main parts:

- head. The head element contains title and meta data of a web document.
- body. The body element contains the information that you want to display on a web page. 

### In a web page, the first tag (specifically, <html>) indicates the markup language that is being used for the document. The <head> tag contains information about the web page. Lastly, the content appears in the <body> tag.


# The Evolution of HTML
## 1. HTML 1.0
The basic version of HTML has support for basic elements like text controls and images. This was the very basic version of HTML with less support for a wide range of HTML elements. It does not have rich features like styling and other things that were related to how content will be rendered in a browser.
The initial version of HTML does not provide support for tables, font support, etc like it provide us in the latest version.

## 2. HTML 4
With the exception of a few elements added in HTML5 (which have been highlighted),the elements you have seen in this book were all available in HTML 4
## 3. HTML 5
In HTML5, web page authors do not need to close all tags, and new elements and attributes will be introduced. At the time of writing,the HTML5 specification had not been completed, but the major browser makers had
started to implement many of the new features, and web page authors were rapidly adopting
the new markup.

# HTML5 Layout
## HTML Layout Elements:
### HTML has several semantic elements that define the different parts of a web page:
- header - Defines a header for a document or a section
- nav- Defines a set of navigation links
- section - Defines a section in a document
- article - Defines an independent, self-contained content
- footer - Defines a footer for a document or a section
- details - Defines additional details that the user can open and close on demand
- summary - Defines a heading for the (details) elemen

### Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.

# Process & Design
### Every website should be designed for the target audienceâ€”not just for yourself or the site owner. It is therefore very important to understand who your target audience is.

## Target Audience: individuals
- What is the age range of your target audience?
- Will your site appeal to more women or men? What is the mix?
- Which country do your visitors live in?
- Do they live in urban or rural areas?
- What is the average income of visitors?
- What level of education do they have?
- What is their marital or family status?
- What is their occupation?
- How many hours do they work per week?
- How often do they use the web?
- What kind of device do they use to access the web?

## Target Audience: Companies
- What is the size of the company or relevant department?
- What is the position of people in the company who visit your site?
- Will visitors be using the site for themselves or for someone else?
- How large is the budget they control?

### Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
###  Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.
### Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
