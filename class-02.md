# Text:
## Structural markup: 
### the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs.

## Semantic markup:
### which provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the meaning of acronyms, and so on.

### semantic markup is HTML that introduces meaning to the web page rather than just presentation. For example, a <p> tag indicates that the enclosed text is a paragraph. This is both semantic and presentational because people know what paragraphs are, and browsers know how to display them.


### HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).


### They also provide semantic information (e.g. where emphasis should be placed, the definition of any acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).

# Introducing CSS:
## What CSS does ?
### CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets with an emphasis placed on “Style.” While HTML is used to structure a web document (defining things like headlines and paragraphs, and allowing you to embed images, video, and other media), CSS comes through and specifies your document’s style—page layouts, colors, and fonts are all determined with CSS.

## How Does CSS Work?
### CSS brings style to your web pages by interacting with HTML elements. Elements are the individual HTML components of a web page—for instance a paragraph—which in HTML.

### A CSS rule is a grouping of one or more CSS properties which are to be applied to one or more target HTML elements. A CSS rule consists of a CSS selector and a set of CSS properties. The CSS selector determines what HTML elements to target with the CSS rule.

# Basic JavaScript Instructions
## STATEMENTS: 
### A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. 
## JavaScript Variable:
- Variable means anything that can vary. JavaScript includes variables which hold the data value and it can be changed anytime.
 - JavaScript uses reserved keyword var to declare a variable. A variable must have a unique name. You can assign a value to a variable using equal to (=) operator when you declare it or before using it.

- Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.
- JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
- Expressions evaluate into a single value.
- Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.


# Decisions and Loops
- If statements - If a condition is true, then run the code in that block.
- If...Else statements - If a condition is true, then run the code in that block. Otherwise, run the code in the else block.
- For loops - Run the code in this block based on a set number of iteration.This is known.
- While loops - Run the code in this block while a condition is true. The number of iterations is unknown.
